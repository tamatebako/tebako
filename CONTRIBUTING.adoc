= Contributing to Tebako

The following are a set of conventions and guidelines that are relevant to
contributors to the Tebako project. These guidelines are based on the
contribution guidelines from the RNP project, as both projects are developed by
Ribose.

== Pull requests

See also: https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review[Thoughtbot's Code Review guide]

Pull Requests should be used for any non-trivial changes. This presents an
opportunity for feedback and allows the CI tests to complete prior to merging.

The `main` branch should generally always be in a buildable and functional state.

Pull Requests should be:

* Focused. Do not include changes that are unrelated to the main purpose of the PR.

* As small as possible. Sometimes large pull requests may be necessary for
adding complex features, but generally they should be kept as small as possible
to ensure a quick and thorough review process.

* Related to a GH issue to which you are assigned. If there is none, file one
(but search first!). This ensures there is no duplication of effort and allows
for a discussion prior to beginning work. (This may not be necessary for PRs
that are purely documentation updates)

* Approved by **2** reviewers before merging.

* Merged by a reviewer via the most appropriate method.

== Branches

Git branches should be used generously. Most branches should be topic branches,
created for adding a specific feature or fixing a specific bug.

Keep branches short-lived (treat them as disposable/transient) and try to avoid
long-running branches.

A good example of using a branch would be:

* User `@joe` notices a bug where a NULL pointer is dereferenced. `@joe` creates GH issue `#500`.
* He creates a new branch to fix this bug named `joe-500-fix-null-deref-in-function`.
* Joe commits a fix for the issue to this new branch.
* Joe creates a Pull Request to merge this branch into main.
* Once merged, Joe deletes the branch since it is no longer useful.

Branch names may vary but should be somewhat descriptive, with words separated
by hyphens. It is also helpful to start the branch name with your GitHub
username, to make it clear who created the branch and prevent naming conflicts.

Remember that branch names may be preserved permanently in the commit history of
`main`, depending on how they are merged.

== Commits

* Try to keep commits as small as possible. This may be difficult or impractical
at times, so use your best judgment.

* Each commit should be buildable and should pass all tests. This helps to
ensure that git bisect remains a useful method of pinpointing issues.

* Commit messages should follow 50/72 rule.

* When integrating pull requests, merge function should be preferred over
squashing. From the other hand, developers should squash commits and create
meaningful commit stack before PR is merged into mainstream branch. Merging
commits like "Fix build" or "Implement comments from code review" should be
avoided.

== Code conventions

The Tebako project includes both C/C++ and Ruby code. Each has its own set of conventions.

=== C/C++ code conventions

==== Code formatting

C/C++ code should be formatted using `clang-format` (v11.0.0), utilizing the
`.clang-format` file included in the repository.

==== Style guide for C/C++

In order to keep the code base consistent, we should define and adhere to a single style.

When in doubt, consult the existing code base.

===== Naming

The following are samples that demonstrate the style for naming different things in C/C++ code:

* Functions: `some_function`
* Variables: `some_variable`
* Filenames: `file-name.c` `file-name.h`
* Struct: `tebako_struct_t`
* Typedefed Enums: `tebako_enum_t`
* Enum Values: `TEBAKO_ENUM_VALUE = 1`
* Constants (macro): `TEBAKO_BUFSIZ`

===== General guidelines for C/C++

Do:

* Do use header guards (`#ifndef SOME_HEADER_H [...]`) in headers.
* Do use `sizeof(variable)`, rather than `sizeof(type)`. Or `sizeof(*variable)` as appropriate.
* Do use commit messages that close GitHub issues automatically, when
applicable. `Fix XYZ. Closes #78.` See
https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/[here].
* Do declare functions `static` when they do not need to be referenced outside the current source file.
* Do always use braces for conditionals, even if the block only contains a single statement.
+
[source,c]
--
if (something) {
  return val;
}
--

* Do use a default failure (not success) value for `ret` variables. Example:
+
[source,c]
--
rnp_result_t ret = RNP_ERROR_GENERIC;
// ...

return ret;
--

Do not:

* Do not use the static storage class for local variables, *unless* they are constant.
+
**Not OK**
+
[source,c]
--
int somefunc() {
  static char buffer[256];
  //...
}
--
+
**OK**
+
[source,c]
--
int somefunc() {
  static const uint16_t some_data[] = {
    0x00, 0x01, 0x02, //...
  };
}
--

* Do not use `pragma`, and try to avoid `__attribute__` as well.
* Do not use uninitialized memory. Try to ensure your code will not cause any errors in valgrind and other memory checkers.

==== Documentation for C/C++

Documentation is done in Doxygen comments format, which must be put in header files.

Exceptions are static or having only definition functions -- it is not required to
document them, however if they are documented then this should be done in the
source file and using the @private tag.

Comments should use doxygen markdown style, like the following example:

[source,c]
--
/** Some comments regarding the file purpose, like 'Tebako filesystem utilities'
 *  @file
 *
 *  This file contains functions and definitions related to the Tebako filesystem.
 *  Ensure to document all public interfaces thoroughly.
 */

/** brief description of the sample function which does something, keyword 'brief' is omitted
 *  Which may be continued here
 *
 *  After an empty line you may add detailed description in case it is needed. You may put
 *  details about the memory allocation, what happens if function fails and so on.
 *
 *  @param param1 first parameter, null-terminated string which should not be NULL
 *  @param param2 integer, some number representing something
 *  @param size number of bytes available to store in buffer
 *  @param buffer buffer to store results, may be NULL. In this case size can be used to
 *                obtain the required buffer length
 *  @return 0 if operation succeeds, or error code otherwise. If operation succeeds then buffer
 *          is populated with the resulting data, and size contains the length of this data.
 *          if error code is E_BUF_TOOSMALL then size will contain the required size to store
 *          the result
 **/
rnp_result_t
tebako_do_operation(const char *param1, const int param2, int *size, char *buffer);
--

=== Ruby code conventions

==== Code formatting

Ruby code should follow the style defined in the `.rubocop.yml` file included in
the repository. We adhere to the Ruby community's conventions with some
project-specific modifications defined in this file.

==== Style guide for Ruby

Ruby code should generally follow the Ruby Style Guide (https://rubystyle.guide/), with customizations specific to the Tebako project.

===== Naming

* Classes and Modules: `CamelCase`
* Methods and Variables: `snake_case`
* Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
* Predicate methods (returning boolean): end with question mark `available?`
* Dangerous methods (modifying `self` or arguments): end with exclamation mark `save!`
* Private methods: `_leading_underscore` (or just use the `private` keyword)

===== General guidelines for Ruby

* Use 2 spaces for indentation, never tabs
* Limit lines to 100 characters when possible
* Use `def` with parentheses when there are parameters
* Use parentheses for method calls with arguments
* Never use `and`/`or` for control flow; use `&&`/`||` instead
* Avoid multi-line ternary operators
* Use `snake_case` for naming files and directories
* Prefer string interpolation and template strings to string concatenation
* Prefer double quotes for strings unless the string contains double quotes

==== Documentation for Ruby

Ruby code should be documented using YARD.

[source,ruby]
--
# A person class to represent individuals
class Person
  # @return [String] the person's full name
  attr_reader :name

  # Creates a new person
  #
  # @param name [String] the person's full name
  # @param age [Integer] the person's age in years
  # @return [Person] a new instance of Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  # Determines if the person is an adult
  #
  # @return [Boolean] true if the person is 18 or older
  def adult?
    @age >= 18
  end
end
--

=== Testing

==== C/C++ testing
:cpp: C++
C/{cpp} code should have appropriate tests. Tests for C/{cpp} code should be:

* Comprehensive, covering normal operation and error conditions
* Written to validate both public API and internal functionality
* Organized in logical test suites

==== Ruby testing

Ruby code should have RSpec tests. Tests for Ruby code should:

* Follow the RSpec style guide
* Use descriptive contexts and examples
* Use appropriate RSpec matchers
* Mock external dependencies when appropriate
* Achieve high test coverage (as reported by the coverage tool)
